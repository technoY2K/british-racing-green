                                multiple teams to build a consistent and unified
                                user interface. The tools used to build the

                                . Gatsby is just a static site generator. Under
                                the hood it's React and JavaScript with most of
                                the build process taken care of by Gatsby. I
                                styled it using styled components using only
                                CSS, no framework for the layout (PHEW). The
                                site is hosted on Netlify.

                                This site was created during the Covid-19
                                pandemic in 2020. Life on this planet at that
                                moment in time was surreal. Busy cities were
                                desolate and grocery store shelves were empty.
                                There were riots in the streets caused by pent
                                up anxiety from the pandemic lockdowns and
                                racial tensions in America. The leader of one of
                                the world's most powerful country was being
                                ruled by a man who embodied the characteristics
                                of the typical billionaire villain you would see
                                in comic books. I always wanted to update my
                                personal site so I guess you can say I had some
                                time on my hands. Alright take care and be safe.
